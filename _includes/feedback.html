  <!-- <h2>Test Yourself</h2>
    <p>
      Do you think you know Ionic? Now you can prove it. I created two tests for 
      <a href="https://kand.io/tests">kandâ€¢io</a>. You can choose either <a href="https://kand.io/tests/details/ionic-react/">Ionic-React</a> or <a href="https://kand.io/tests/details/ionic-angular/">Ionic-Angular</a>, enabling you to show off your Ionic expertise.
