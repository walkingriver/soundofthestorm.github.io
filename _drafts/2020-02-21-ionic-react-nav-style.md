A while ago I made a post I titled "Confessions of a Reluctant Ionic-React Fan". That post led to an experiment where I began to recreate using Ionic-React a subset of one of my existing Ionic v4 apps written in Angular. I will continue building that application in this post by adding some navigation and styling. I hope you will join me on this exciting journey.

This is the third in a series on my experience with Ionic-React.

# The Application
As I mentioned previously, the app I am reproducing is called Bravo! It is a tiny app I wrote to help pass the time when waiting in line, on a road trip, or other times you find yourself with lots of time and little to do. You can download it here [for Android](http://bit.ly/android-bravo) or [for iOS](http://bit.ly/ios-bravo). 

# Finishing the Instructions Page
I left styling off the Home (Instructions) page, so let us start by finishing that now. 

# Conclusion

These are some of the things that still need to be done. 
- Game Page 
- Game Card
- Footer Bar, Also Black
- Score Boxes

In my next post, I will try to get the UI working for the game page, even if there are no mechanics yet. 

The repository for this code is publicly hosted on GitHub, so you can follow my progress or even issue pull requests if you wish.
