The project was almost done. The Angular UI was working; the Node Web API middle tier was fully implemented and doing its thing. We were in a meeting, showing off our efforts to our new manager. Suddenly he stopped and asked us, "May I see your API documentation?" We looked around nervously, because it did not yet exist. Well, maybe it did, somewhat, to a point, at least a little big. It was a hodgepodge of Wiki pages, Google Docs, and I think a Sharepoint page that was never finished. As the team lead, it fell to me to explain that we had not yet created a consolidated API document. That was the wrong answer. He gently but firmly let me know that the API _would be_ documented, and that we would use Swagger.

# Swagger
I have used [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) before, and find it very useful for creating APIs from a spec. The trouble is, I probably have not used it professionally in years. Now it was to be our standard, and I was assigned to add it to an existing, fully-implemented API. I did what you might do: I took to Twitter and Google to find out the best and quickest tool for the job.
