I have often been asked what advice I would give to someone just starting out as a software developer. It is not an easy question to answer, because the term "software developer" can mean different things to different people. Everyone's journey is unique. My own path certainly cannot be duplicated by someone starting out now, and it probably looks different than every one of my peers'. This post is my attempt to provide that advice, regardless of where you are on your own path.

# What are your interests?

The first thing you need to figure out is where you want to go. What are your personal interests? As I mentioned above, I look at this as a journey. And like a real journey, you need to know where you want to go before you can plan how you get there. Imagine we are discussing a road trip instead of software development. My telling you how to get to Orlando makes no sense if you want to go to Anaheim. 



# Where are you?

The next most important thing on your journey is to know where you are right now. Continuing the road trip metaphor, if you heading to Orlando, your plan will be much different if you are starting in New York versus starting in Dallas. Telling you to head south on the interstate from New York will get you close. Taking the interstate south from Dallas will end in disappointment.
