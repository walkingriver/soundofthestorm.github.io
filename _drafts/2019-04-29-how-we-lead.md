This is the third post in my series about learning and teaching. In [the first post](https://walkingriver.com/how-we-learn/), I discussed the four stages that everyone goes through when learning something new. In the second, I described different aspects of teaching students who are in each of those stages. In this post, I'll tie them together and discuss how to lead someone (or a team) through these same stages.

To recap the four stages of learning, they are:

1. Unconscious incompetence: <i>You don't know what you don't know</i>
1. Conscious incompetence: <i>You understand what you don't know and want to learn</i>
1. Conscious competence: <i>You start to understand, with effort</i>
1. Unconscious competence: <i>You internalize your understanding and no longer have to thing about it. You just "get it."</i>
