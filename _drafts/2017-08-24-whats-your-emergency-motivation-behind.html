<h2> The Motivation Behind My Latest Pluralsight Course</h2>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">By now you’ve probably heard some of the excitement about Ionic, a tremendous
  framework for rapidly building high quality cross platform mobile apps. But using Ionic for building desktop apps?
  Maybe you think I’m joking, but I’m not. In this post I'm going to describe a modest desktop app using the Ionic
  Framework.</span><br />

<h2><span style="font-family: inherit;">Ionic and Electron for a Desktop App</span></h2>
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">You may be asking yourself why
  bother using a mobile framework to build a desktop app? There are a few reasons that come to mind:</span><br />
<ul>
  <li>Perhaps you need an app that runs equally well on a mobile device, maybe an iPad or Android tablet, and you want
    the experience to match that of the desktop version.</li>
  <li>You and your users appreciate the simpler, cleaner experience that many mobile apps offer, and you want to
    duplicate that experience on the desktop.</li>
  <li>Or it could be that your development budget is tight, and you want to keep things as lean as possible.</li>
</ul><span style="font-family: inherit;">In my case, it’s a combination of all three. Whatever your motivations,
  starting with the Ionic Framework is a great decision. Its clean and attractive components, and easy to learn but
  powerful API, combine to enable a great user experience.</span><br /><br />
<h3><span style="font-family: inherit;">What Problem Are We Solving?</span></h3><span style="font-family: inherit;">Have
  you ever had to call for police, an ambulance, or fire department in an emergency? Most, if not all countries have a
  special number to dial for such situations. In the United States, it’s 9-1-1. In the UK, the number is 9-9-9. Other
  parts of Europe use 1-1-2. I’ll try to keep it generic and simply refer to “emergency services,” but 9-1-1 may pop up
  occasionally, because I am in the US.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vWfqcQn8nQg/WZ7h0A4VVuI/AAAAAAAAF4M/76oVTc9eTSYLFAXD-kZjBHWV6WQLNBzWwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/psap.jpg"

      width="320" /></a></div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Have you ever wondered what happens if you dial
  emergency services, and you can’t give them your location for some reason? How would they know where to find you? It
  used to be simple. Your phone number was tied to your home or office. When you call for help, a screen pops up in
  front of the emergency services personnel with your address. Simple. Until it got complex.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span
  style="font-family: inherit;">In the late 1980s, cellular phones made locating a caller in an emergency a much more
  difficult problem. You could be calling from anywhere. GPS-enabled phones in the 1990s helped to solve that problem,
  but another quiet revolution was taking place in the enterprise; one that required a different solution.</span><br /><span

<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">In a large office complex, spanning potentially
    dozens of buildings?</span></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TFZRmSyKMMY/WZ7h79cGmKI/AAAAAAAAF4M/coREqLt4VCs-hD0ztwskJFsc3MOSQAyBwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/campus.jpg"

<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: inherit;">If
  you’re sitting at your desk at work one day and suddenly have an emergency, how does the person on the other end of
  the phone know where to find you? What does that person’s screen show as your address?</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span
  style="font-family: inherit;">In many cases, the address displayed will be the billing address of your employer. Not
  very helpful unless you happen to be sitting in that exact spot. And even if the street address is correct, where in
  that vast office complex are you? What building, floor, room, etc.?</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span
  style="font-family: inherit;">You can imagine that this is a difficult problem, but fortunately it has been solved by
  most of the enterprise phone system vendors, such as Cisco, Avaya, and others. They have technology that can pinpoint
  the exact phone that placed the emergency call, and even alert local on-site security personnel and first-responders.
  So if you’re using one of these vendors at work, all is well, right?</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span
  style="font-family: inherit;">Well, there is one other edge case that even the big companies have a difficult time
  with: softphones, such as Skype or Avaya OneX Communicator. Some large companies provide these softphones to their
  employees so that even when they are away from the office, a call to their office number will ring on their laptop.
  It’s a great convenience, but it compounds the emergency call location problem.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span
  style="font-family: inherit;">If you’re working on your laptop in a Starbucks in Washington, DC, but your office
  number is tied to your desk in Chicago, no one will find you if you dial 9-1-1.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span
  style="font-family: inherit;">That’s the gap being filled by companies such as 911 Secure. When your company
  subscribes to their services, your office phone number is registered with them. Your company’s phone system is
  configured to route emergency calls through a 911 Secure-managed service, which will dynamically look up your present
  location, and re-route the call to the nearest emergency services location, relaying your physical address at the
  same time.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fKzMJSqmxPA/Wt3p9IXM-nI/AAAAAAAAU8s/fTuyBvtG3u42VSzfH5w_iHGgLFi5-dx9wCLcBGAs/s1600/911secure.com_%2528PS%2529.png"
    imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720"
      data-original-width="1280" height="360" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fKzMJSqmxPA/Wt3p9IXM-nI/AAAAAAAAU8s/fTuyBvtG3u42VSzfH5w_iHGgLFi5-dx9wCLcBGAs/s640/911secure.com_%2528PS%2529.png"
      width="640" /></a></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><span style="font-family: inherit;">You
  simply need to tell 911 Secure where you are at any given time, before there’s an emergency. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: inherit;">Unfortunately,
  that tends to be a manual process. That’s where our sample app comes in.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span
  style="font-family: inherit;">This is the motivation behind the application showcased in my <a href="https://goo.gl/aJ4Y8e"
    target="_blank">Pluralsight course, Creating Cross-platform Apps with Ionic and Electron</a>.&nbsp;</span><br /><span
  style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span>Apart from being the subject of the online course, the application is now
officially part of 911 Secure's product offerings, rebranded as Gatekeeper. If you would like to see how it was built,
and how you can use Ionic and Electron together to build cross platform desktop apps, I'd love it if you'd watch it,
and let me know what you think.<br /><br />
